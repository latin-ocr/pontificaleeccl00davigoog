or supplements might occasionally be needed lor Forms relating to personages
of Royal or Episcopal dignity3 for members of religious communities, hermits,
penitents, for the Holy Oils, and occasional Benedictions.

As the Manuale (ed. Henderson, pp. 96*-103*) included certain ‘benedie-
tioaes episcoporum et suffrayaaeorum,’ so in some Pontifieolia ere found certain
Offices which, as a general rule, would fall under the province of the Parish
Priest.

Thus, in Edmund Lecy’s Pontifical (Ab. rear-1456, ed. Barnes, pp. 242-
275) there are the Officium Pereprinorum, ad faciendum Gatheemneaum, ad
socienda Sponsalia, and ad sepeliendum Μονίαοε.(1

In these the title ‘sacerdos’ and not ‘episcopua’ occurs in the Rubrics.

similarly in Mr. Maskell’s account of the Pontifical of Anianus of Bangor
(Ab. 1270, Mea. aa. Ι. cxxxiv-v.) we may observe Forms for Baptism, ⁰ for
Merriage, ‘for communion [and Unction] of the Sick, ⁸ and the commendatione
[and Burial Servios] ;11 as well as the Benediction ol Bread, Blessing of Oandles
and of Palms, which come naturally in the Processional, besides e set of votive
Messes (with Prefeces and Canon) somevvhat similar to that in Serum Breviories,
end in Breviaries of some other Uses about the years 1495-1516.

The Pontifical of Archbishop Ohichele contains the Form for the Churching
of Women. ¹

The Contents of the Sidney-Sussex MS. (which we will call ‘A.’) ¹ eor-
respond so closely with the Egbert Pontifieal (or ‘E.'), that it will be sufficient
for the most part to give simply the opening words of each Preyer, with a re-
ference to the peges of Mr. Greenwell’s edition. Surtces Society's vol. XXVII.

(1853.)

But the very first thing in the MS. is worthy of notice; for, in a Rubrio im-
ported verbatim from the Canens of the IVth Council ol Carthago (Ab. 398),
it assigns to the Perish Priest the sole authority of admission to the Choir,
without mentioning the examinetion by the Archdeacon :—
