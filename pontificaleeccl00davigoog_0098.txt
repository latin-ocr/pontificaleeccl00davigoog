N o complete Pontifical of English Use has ever been printed for contempo· ,
raneous usage.⁶ But these various pamphlets—whether preserved singly, or

bound in small volumes for the use of Bishops or others-represent traditionally
the old universal custom. Such vernacular Offices (which some may live to see
improved, augmented, and codified) have served to keep alive the remembrance
of the Bishop’s indefeasible right to authorize the necdful Forms and Orders for
his Diocese: and they have supplied in every age the necessary gloss upon the
exception in the Oanonical subscription, which reserves such cases where it

. ‘shall be ordered by lawful authority!

It will be seen that whereas De Bernham’s Pontifical contains only Forms
for Oonsecration (and Reconciliation) of Ohurchcs and Ohurchyards, Orosses and
Altars3 and the Sidney Sussex College Book of Saint Outhbert had (originally)
only the Ordination and confirmation Services,-the Pontificule Ecyberhti
contains :-
