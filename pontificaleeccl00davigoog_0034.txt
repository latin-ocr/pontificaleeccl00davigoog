the 6th, Benvie on the 9th, and Logie (now, perhaps, better known as
Lochee) beside Duudee on the rrth. He is next at Blairgowrie ou the

Liviugston on the last day of the mouth, and closes his year’s energetic
labours with the Dedication of S. Giles', Edinburgh, on the 6th ol

Early iu the Spring of 1244 he has again sought the South of Seot
land, aud is at Ellam in Lougformaeus ou 11th March; aud then, after
Easter‚ returns upon Athelstaueford on 7th April, Traneut on the rrth,
Oranston ou the 17th, and Salton on the 21st. From Haddingtonshire‚
he proceeds once more into Berwickshire, and dedicates the Ohurch of the
