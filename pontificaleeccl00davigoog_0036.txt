xxvi INTRODUOTION.

I will conclude with a few notes on the MS. 01 De Bemham's Pon-
tifioal itself.

The Greek Alphabet (101. 17, = p. 7a), 01 which the forms of the
letters are given in faosimile, occupies three lines iu the original 1 ι,
a σ, r a (δ 11 omitted, ς and toppo introduced, and 1 a repeated
11 the end).

P. 8b. The Title “ 3111111111) 0111111111” 11 written in the margin.
So also is the Rubric (fol. 34, a p. 12a) “Ha Consecratur* OEmr'tarium,
siquod faerit Ooosecroadum” which commences a new column iu the MS.

At the bottom 01 p. 45 (= 101. 117Β) the Rubric “Deinde . . . Ea
1111111111 11111101 0111111” 11 1 marginal addition in black inlr.

“ Explicet dc Ouarar-attona 11111111 cruc& is a Rubriano at the top 01
the page, in the margin. There are traces 01 1 book-marker having been
sewu on this leaf at 11111 place. There was a marker also at 101. 98Β.,
the blessing 01 the Altar Linea, &o (p. 3 5a bottom), and there the eye

The commencement 01 the Order for Camarataho of o Oroas (101. 118,

2 p. 42b) 11 marked by 1 slightly decorated Calvary Crosa in red ink.

The word “Nom.,” or Notandum, 11 written in the margin against 1111
latter part 01 the Rubric which appears on p. 151, = 101 41, also at tha
commencement of the Rubric “arasa” p. 11, = 101. 61, and (in pale
11111) near the end 01 the Rubric on p. 24b, = fol. 69B.

“Hic incipiar’ 11 written over against the Oollect ou p. 3 3a‚ = fol. 92.

The Invocations in the Litany, p. 27, 1111 into double columns with
the words “Spiritus Sancte Deus ;’' the second column contains only the
words “Omnes Sancti Angeli .. . prophetae,” the word “Orate'’ not ap-
pearing in‘the original in that instance. The carso 01 101. 77 commences
