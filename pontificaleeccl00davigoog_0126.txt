84 seranum v.

and S. Paul, S. Michael, All Saints, Martinmas‚ and S. Andrew (who has a vigil
also), have two benedictions each-other Saints’ days have one.

In the Baunnrorronan or Rouana, which is said to be of the same age as
AEthelwold's, we find a somewhat more elaborate work in three parts. The first
and second of them together form a Benedictional of thc same character as that
which has been just described. The third is a collection of Benedictiones od
diuerso of a totally different character. It is in fact a Pontifical. And its (lon-
tents may bc stated here, after we have said a word about the two parts contain-
ing benedictiones episcopales which precede it.

Part I. (the Temporale) contains one Benediction only for every Sanday
from Christmas to Advent, and one euch for several principal Perias. Besides
these, there isa Benedictio Cinaram incapite Jejnnii, Ad Bomos Palmae-um,
ccnd Consecrotio Crismatia et Olec' in Cena Domini, with Benedictio ad Mundo·
cumipse die.

Part 11. (de festivitatibus Sanctorum ) contains one caah for twenty-six
Saints' days (inclusive of those in Christmastide). Candlemas, Michaelmas, and
hh Saints have two. The Nativity of S. John Baptist, S. Peter and S. Paul, and
S. Andrew, have a Vigil Benediction beside those for the day, which are among
those already counted. There ara nine de Communi Sanctorum, and upwards
of twenty for Ordinations, Week-days, and various occasions.

Part 111. which may be called the Pontificol proper, appended to Robert's
Benedictions contains the following :—

[Sermo ad populum de Dedicatione. Manu posteriora]
