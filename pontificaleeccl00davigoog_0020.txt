INTRODUGTION.

LIST OF OHUROHES.

With Mr. Gammack's help we have been able to trace the titles or
Dedications of seveuty Churches‚ or exactly half the entire number on De

Bernham's list, and also the two in the Wishart memoranda.

Itis remarkable that not even one of those which have been identi-
fied was dedicated on the festival of the Saint whose name is commemo·
rated in its title. The most that we cau say is that, in three or four
instances, the Dedicatiou was performed on a day which occurred very
shortly before the Feast of the Title.

Tbat the two coincided in no one of the instaures before us is the
more remarkable, when we observe that, in some of the entries marked
withan asterisk, es attested by the nepta. Prior. S. Andreoe (p. 348)‚a
Weslem Dedication is coupled with what we may suppose to have been
theold Keltio traditional name of the Church. ’

It seems not uureasonable to suppose that, in such a case as that of
S. Laurenoe and S. Coman, Rossiecleraoh, the former title, that of the
Saint of Catholic fame, was given for the first time ou the occasion of the
Dedicstion by Bishop de Bernham, and that the name of the local Saint
was retained out of respect to the conservative feeling of the place.

Some instances of similar combinations, in the case of Comish

Churches, are given by Mr. W. Ο. Borlase in his Ape os tte Scires (1878)
pp. 68, 84.
