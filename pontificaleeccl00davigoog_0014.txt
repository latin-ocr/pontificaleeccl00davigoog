and the 17th century Note, “pota ec inserta SS. Latonia esse Anylchaaum.

Fols. 2 and 3 contain an interesting record os many Ohurches and
Chapels for which the volume was used, by two Bishops of S. Andrews‚
in the years 1240-1249 and 1276 respectively.

Folio 3 uerso contains a short Tohle os Contenta in red letters.

The initials on this page have never been supplied by the illuminator
or corrector, although throughout the body of the volume they have been·
duly inserted. The Table was, of course, written after the Pontifical itself.

We print this Table in its proper place at the commencement of the
Pontifical.

As a Parish Priest may use the {ly-leaf of his Prayer Book to enter
temporarily the register of children privately baptized by him in houses3
or as l have seen names of parishioners written in the waste leaf of a
Sarum Breviary, presumably in order that they might be rememhered at
the Altar3 so, it was natural enough to use the ily-leaves os the Office
Book itself sor registering the Consecration or Reconciliation os Churches.

I should inser from the handwriting that the entries were not made
singly, but in batches of several at a time.

A paragraph mark is put in the margin in the places which we have
shown in the printed copy, and a numeral “.C.” shows that the entries
were counted up. The hand in which this list is written is minute and
not very clear. lt is similar in character to that which Ι have observed
in some of the early Diocesan and Capitular Registers of Lineoln Diocese.
After the hundredth entrya fresh hand commences. The two entries
relating to the Episcopate of William Wishart are in rather larger and
coarser writing.

It is rather surprising that so many as 140 Churches should have ’
been Dedicated by one Bishop in the space of about ten years; and at
once Ι was inclined to suppose that there must have been some special

order drawing attention to the neglect of the ceremony in the previous
generation.
The following suggestion (which is due to Canon Bell) appears to
