INTRODUCTION. xxvii

Τὴε words referring to a Dedication, “in honore Sancta Trinitatis,”
are (on p. 13 and wherever they occur) an interlineation in the original,
that Dedication being presumably less common than one in memory ol
some one or other of the Saints.

Alter reminding the reader that all credit for editing the Text os
De Bemham's Pontifical is due to the Reverend Gnoson Har Foanns, late
Incumbent of S. Serf's, Burntisland‚ who entered into rest on Sunday,
Nov. 7th, 1875, four weeks after his brother the Bishop of Brechin,-I

would here record my gratitude to Henry Bradshaw, qu, of King’s Col·
lege, Cambridge, for some suggestions made while this Introduction was
in the Press; to the Very Rev. W. G. Henderson, D.C.L., for the use os
books and ΜΒ. notes; to William Maskell, Esq, for solving some of my
doubts in addition to help derived from his hduryy and Monumeuta Ritu·
alic,· to James Α. Η. Murray, Esq, LL.D., for the latest information
concerning the Durham Ritual; to the Rev. The Master os Sidney-Sussex
college, Cambridge, and the Rev. J. Wale Hiclrs ; as well as to Miss
Phelps, lor information given about the [siber S. Cutltberti at times when I
was unable to pay visits to Cambridge myself.

I have already stated my obligations to Mons. Delisle and to Mons.
Omont, relative to the Pontifical itsell3 and it will be obvious that a
great part ol the interesting character of this volume, such as it has for
Sootsmen and others, is due to the Rev. James Gammack of Aberdeen
and to Canon Walter Bell.

I desire also to record my gratitudo to the late Very Rev. the Dean,
and to the Venerable the Archdeacon os Bangor, and to the Rev. 0. Evans,
sor putting every facility in my way towards securing a deliberate exam·

ination of the valuable Pontifical which bears the name of Arrianus οἱ
Bangor.
