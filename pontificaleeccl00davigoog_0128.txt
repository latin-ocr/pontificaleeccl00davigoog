from 1268 ιο 1293, excepting a period during which King Eclward l. had deprived him. 'Ibe Arch-
bishcp had plauded with the King for his restoration, in letters which are preserved by wilkins in
the Concilio, Vol. Il. Peckham could therefore write ta Auienus 11. cf S. Amph with all the
greater authority, pressing him ιο enlcroe the Statutes cf Otho aud Othobon, ιο see that the Clergy
of his Welsh Diccese conformed to those cl the rest of the world in dress and manners-not wearing

No special mention cl the Episcopal Benedicticns, ncr or any purely liturgical change, is here
made in writiug from Bangor to S. Asaph; but, if the Benedictiones ars rightly described as edite a
ammobili patre, fratrc Jobaaae de Pachom, archiepiscopo, cantuariensi, it seeum not unreascnable tc
suppose that the Pontifical which contains such a collection was acquired by Auienus of Bangcr at
the time of the Archbislrcp's risit to that city in 1284, cr before that date aad 1307, when the Bishcp
of Bangor wue succeeded by Griffin ap Yerward.

In the first secticu of the volume, fclios 2, 3, 5, 6, 'lare much mutilated, haring only the lower

It is remarkable that in tha Intercessions, aiter the usual suffrage for the domem apostolicum
there follows one for archipresulem acetrum et gregem eibi commitam, and no mention of the Bishcp.
